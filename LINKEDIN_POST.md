Just shipped v1 of a minimal regex engine from scratch! 🚀

Built a tiny Python regex engine that supports literals, wildcards (`.`), and the `*` operator using recursive backtracking. It's part of a creative coding project exploring "Pattern Keys" — forbidden codes that unlock hidden meaning in text.

**What I built:**
✅ Pattern matching with `matches(pattern, text)`
✅ `find_all_matches()` to find all matching substrings
✅ Comprehensive unittest test suite (13 tests, all passing)
✅ Greedy matching for `*` operator
✅ Full documentation + creative worldbuilding notes

**Tech highlights:**
- Recursive backtracking algorithm
- Clean, well-documented code
- Edge case handling (empty strings, non-ASCII, etc.)
- No external dependencies

This was a great exercise in:
🔹 Understanding regex internals
🔹 Implementing backtracking algorithms
🔹 Writing comprehensive tests
🔹 Balancing technical work with creative storytelling

The project includes both the technical implementation and creative lore notes — because sometimes the best learning happens when you combine engineering with imagination.

Just built a minimal regex engine from scratch in Python! 🎯

Supports literals, `.` wildcards, and `*` operator using recursive backtracking. Includes comprehensive tests and creative worldbuilding notes about "Pattern Keys."

Great exercise in understanding regex internals and implementing backtracking algorithms. Sometimes the best learning happens when you combine engineering with imagination.
